"""
Thin RabbitMQ wrapper built on `pika`.

Topology:
  exchange:  "eventsphere.events"  (topic, durable)
  queues:    one durable queue per consuming service, bound with a
             routing pattern e.g. "eventsphere.#" (all events) or
             "eventsphere.paymentsucceeded" (one event type).

Reliability:
  - publisher confirms are enabled
  - messages are published as persistent (delivery_mode=2)
  - consumers manually ack only after successful processing; on
    exception the message is nacked and requeued once, then dead-lettered
    to `<queue>.dlq` to avoid poison-message loops.
  - consumers should perform their own idempotency check (e.g. an
    `event_id` uniqueness table) since RabbitMQ only guarantees
    at-least-once delivery.
